# Quantium Sales Inisght Dashboard

This project is a data analysis and interactive dashboard built as part of the **Quantium Virtual Experience Program** on Forage. It explores sales trends for Quantium's "Pink Morsel" product and allows region-specific insights through an interactive interface.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to help **Soul Foods** (a Quantium client) determine whether **sales increased after a price change on January 15, 2021**. The dashboard uses sales data from three CSV files and features:

- **Line chart of daily sales over time**
- **Region filter via radio buttons** (north, east, south, west, all)
- A custom pink-themed UI
- Automated testing with Pytest & Dashâ€™s testing tools
- A CI-friendly test script (`run_tests.sh`)
